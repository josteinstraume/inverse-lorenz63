# inverse-lorenz63
This paper seeks to find an optimal set of hyperparameters for residual networks (ResNets) of varying architectures such that the causal factors that produce the chaotic dynamical system of a given Lorenz-1963 attractor are modeled effectively. DeepXDE is used to construct the ordinary differential equations of the Lorenz system, generate training data, and define model architecture. Tensorflow is used for hyperparameter tuning, and Google Colaboratory Pro is leveraged for GPU training.
